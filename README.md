# ETL Pipeline with PySpark

## Overview

This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using PySpark, a powerful framework for large-scale data processing. The pipeline extracts data from JSON and CSV files, transforms it to perform necessary operations, and loads the transformed data into a CSV output file.

## Technologies Used

- **PySpark**: Used for distributed data processing with Python.
- **Spark SQL**: Used for querying structured data inside Spark programs.
- **Python**: Programming language used for scripting and defining data transformations.
- **JSON and CSV**: File formats for data extraction and storage.
- **Git**: Version control system for collaborative development.
- **Pytest**: Framework for testing Python code.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **main.py**: Entry point for the ETL pipeline, initializes Spark session and orchestrates the data flow.
- **scripts/**
  - **extract.py**: Contains classes for data extraction from JSON and CSV files.
  - **transform.py**: Implements data transformations using PySpark DataFrame API.
  - **load.py**: Handles loading of transformed data into a CSV file.
- **tests/**: Directory for unit tests.
- **data/**: Directory containing sample JSON and CSV data files.

## Pipeline Logic

1. **Initialization**: The `main.py` script initializes a Spark session to start processing data.
2. **Extraction**: Data is extracted from JSON and CSV files using the `Extract` class in `extract.py`.
3. **Transformation**: The `Transform` class in `transform.py` processes the extracted data. It performs operations like adding new columns, joining datasets, and ensuring data quality.
4. **Loading**: Transformed data is loaded into a CSV file using the `Load` class in `load.py`.
5. **Output**: The final output is stored in the `output/etl_output.csv` file.

## Problems Faced

1. **Schema Mismatch**: Ensuring that the schema of extracted data matches the expected format in transformation steps.
2. **Column Missing Errors**: Handling errors due to missing columns in extracted data files.
3. **Execution Plans**: Dealing with large execution plans in Spark, which required tuning the logging level and configuration parameters.
4. **Unit Testing**: Setting up unit tests with Pytest for ensuring the correctness of data transformations and pipeline behavior.

## Running the Project

To run the ETL pipeline:

1. Ensure you have Python and PySpark installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jteoni/pyspark-etl-nyctaxi.git
   cd pyspark-etl-nyctaxi
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requeriments.txt
4. Execute the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
